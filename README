All code is covered under the GNU GPL license.  Unless otherwise stated in a

You will need SDL and libgamemusic available to build this port.

Build instructions:

 ./autogen.sh        # Only needed if building git version
 ./configure && make

This will produce ./src/kfile1 which should be placed in the same directory
as the Kiloblaster data files (just like the DOS .EXE file.)  If you don't have the
data files handy, all three episodes have been released as freeware and can be
downloaded from http://www.classicdosgames.com/game/Kiloblaster.html

If you encounter any problems with this port or need help, please ask on the
RGB Classic Games forum at http://www.classicdosgames.com/forum/  You can also
get help here if you are stuck somewhere in the game!

Known issues:

 - Will only run on little-endian CPUs due to endian-specific file handling.
